# Spacing display and flex

In this app, it is possible to set indentation, display, and flex styles from Bootstrap 5. I didn't move the documentation for these styles here, deciding that I'd rather leave links to the official documentation.

- **Padding:** [Bootstrap Padding Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/#horizontal-centering)
- **Display:** [Bootstrap Display Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/display/)
- **Flex:** [Bootstrap Flex Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/)

These styles are located on the following path:

- The styles connection file: `src/styles/bootstrap.scss`
- The styles themselves are located at the following path: `src/styles/bootstrap`
